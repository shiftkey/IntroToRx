    IntroToRx.com is the online resource for getting started with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609">Reactive Extensions to .Net</a>. Originally starting life as a <a href="http://leecampbell.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/reactive-extensions-for-net.html">blog series</a>, it has now flourished into an online book. You can read
    it online here via the website, or get a copy of the Kindle edition for reading
    offline.
</p>
<p>
    The content is complete and targets version is 1.0.10621.0 (NuGet: Rx-Main v1.0.11226). Note that v2 of Rx has has since been released
    which has some new cool features. Those features are largely an addition to the
    v1 functionality and are mostly advanced features anyway. So, you are still best off learning v1 before getting too carried
    away with the v2 features.
</p>
<p>
    While you brush up on the foundations of Rx by reading about v1, you can be assured that we are
    busily working away on getting content updated for Rx v2.0, but rest assured that the v1 content will live on.
